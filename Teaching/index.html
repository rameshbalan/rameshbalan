			<h1>2017</h1>
			<h2>1441 CELL AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY LAB - FALL 2017;</h2>
			<h2>Classes of 20-25 students</h2>
			<h3>Description</h3>
			<p align="justify">The first of a two-part introductory biology sequence, this course focuses on the chemical and molecular basis of life, including metabolism, cell structure and function, and genetics. Laboratory experiments are complement topics presented in lecture.  I designed all quizzes in addition to being responsible for all lab grading. Learning outcome of the program is  Critical thinking skills, Empirical and Quantitative Analysis  Skills.</p>
			<h2>2175 HUMAN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY I LAB - SUMMER 2017;</h2>
			<h2> Class of 24 students</h2>
			<h3>Description</h3>
			<p align="justify">In this lab, the general principles of physiological mechanisms at the cellular, tissue, organ, and organismal levels were discussed. Because this course was directed predominantly towards pre-nursing students, there was a heavy focus on the human species with clinical and laboratory examples. Because physiology can only be explained in terms of the underlying anatomy, an equally heavy focus was placed on anatomy. Topics included the organization of the human body (i.e., anatomical terms, cells, and tissues) and the anatomy and basic physiology of the integumentary, musculoskeletal, nervous, and sensory systems.</p>
