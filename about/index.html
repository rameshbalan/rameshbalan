			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I was born in Tirunelveli, Tamilnadu, India. My dad served the Indian Air Force which provided me the opportunity to explore the diversity, in various states of India. So, I did my schooling in cities like Agra, Bangalore, Tirunelveli and Coimbatore to name a few. The passion for Biology and a drive for contributing to the society through research made me choose Biotechnology for my undergraduate degree. This exposed me to various sub-disciplines in field like Cell and Molecular Biology, Genetics, Biochemistry, Pathogenesis, Bioinformatics, Genomics and PERL for Computational Biology. I liked Bioinformatics of all the others because of its potential greatly explained to me by my mentor <a  href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3K_nC68AAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Dr. Stephen Rapheal</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1h7K9DYAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Dr. T. Sathish Kumar</a>.I decided to pursue my interest for the field through research by applying for B.S to Ph. D program in University of Texas which provided me the right platform to apply the skills that I learned. Also, it gave me the opportunity to acquire new skills by solving various problems during the course of my research. I am working under the guidance of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YFugZqwAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Dr. Jeffery Demuth</a> who was generous to accept me in his lab as a graduate student.</p>
